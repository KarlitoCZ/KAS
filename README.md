### Karlito's Aiming Software
IA. Powered aimbot and trigger-bot for general use in python
This cheat is a proof of concept not anywhere close to being as powerful as an external or internal cheat

### Common Problems
1. The model used in the repo is not trained on specific characters in games
2. Slow and may not always work as expected (depending on the game)

### Running the cheat
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Run main.py
4. Make sure that the overlay isn't in focus
5. If you encounter a problem please open an issue or make a PR.
6. Check out the config.py
   
### Modifing
I highly recommend changing the code or the model to fit your needs, 
you can find the main logic is in detect.py.
If you train your own AI. model and modify the aimbot it will work way better.
