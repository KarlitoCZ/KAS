### Karlito's Aiming Software
IA. Powered aimbot and trigger-bot for general use in python

### Common Problems
1. The model used in the repo is not trained on specific characters in games
2. Slow and may not always work as expected (depending on the game)

### Running the cheat
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Run main.py
4. If you encounter a problem please open an issue or make a PR.
5. Also check out the config.py
   
### Modifing
I highly recommend changing the code or the model to fit your needs, 
you can find the main logic is in detect.py
